Islam is a strictly monotheistic religion that was revealed by God to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in the 7th century CE in Arabia. Muslims believe that Muhammad is the last and most perfect of God's messengers, who include Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and others. The sacred scripture of Islam is the Qur'an, which contains God's words and guidance for humanity[^2^]. Muslims also follow the Sunnah, which is the example and teachings of Muhammad as recorded in the books of hadith.
 
Islam teaches that there is only one God who is worthy of worship and that He has no partners or associates. Islam also teaches that God has created everything in the universe with a purpose and that He will judge everyone according to their deeds on the Day of Resurrection. Islam enjoins Muslims to submit to God's will and to follow His commands, such as praying five times a day, fasting in Ramadan, giving charity, performing pilgrimage to Mecca, and being kind and just to others.
