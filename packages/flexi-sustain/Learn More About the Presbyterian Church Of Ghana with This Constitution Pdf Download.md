## The History of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana
 
The Presbyterian Church of Ghana has a long and rich history that spans over two centuries. The church was founded by the Basel Mission, a Swiss-German missionary society that sent its first missionaries to Ghana in 1828. The missionaries established schools, hospitals, printing presses, and churches among the Akan people of southern Ghana. They also translated the Bible and other Christian literature into the local languages, such as Twi and Ga.
 
The church grew rapidly under the leadership of indigenous pastors and evangelists, who faced many challenges and persecutions from colonial authorities and traditional rulers. The church also participated in the struggle for independence and social justice in Ghana. In 1922, the church became autonomous from the Basel Mission and adopted the name Presbyterian Church of the Gold Coast. In 1957, when Ghana attained independence from Britain, the church changed its name to Presbyterian Church of Ghana.
 
Today, the Presbyterian Church of Ghana has over 800,000 members in more than 4,000 congregations across the country. It also has missions and partnerships in other African countries and around the world. The church is a member of the World Communion of Reformed Churches, the All Africa Conference of Churches, and the Christian Council of Ghana. The church is led by a Moderator, who is elected by the General Assembly every four years.
