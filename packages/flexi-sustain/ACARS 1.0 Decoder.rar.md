ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System) is a digital data link system for transmission of short messages between aircraft and ground stations via radio or satellite. ACARS messages can contain flight status, weather reports, maintenance information, and more.

If you have an RTL-SDR dongle and a suitable antenna, you can receive and decode ACARS messages with your computer. You will also need some software to process the signals and display the messages. One such software is ACARS Decoder[^1^], an open source, multi-channel realtime ACARS decoder for Linux. It features:
 
- up to four channels decoded simultaneously
- error detection and correction
- input from sound file, alsa sound card or software defined radio (SDR) via a rtl dongle (http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr) or airspy (http://www.airspy.com)
- output to a server via UDP in planeplotter format or its own dedicated format

To use ACARS Decoder, you will need to download the source code from SourceForge[^1^] and compile it on your Linux system. You will also need to install some dependencies, such as librtlsdr, libairspy, libsndfile, libasound2, and libpthread. You can find more details on how to install and use ACARS Decoder in the README file included in the source code.
 
Alternatively, you can also use other ACARS decoding programs, such as acarsdec[^2^], which is a fork of ACARS Decoder with some improvements and extensions. It also comes with acarsserv, a database backend program to store received acars messages. You can find acarsdec on GitHub[^2^] and follow the instructions there to install and run it.
 
Once you have your ACARS decoding software ready, you can connect your RTL-SDR dongle to your computer and tune it to one or more ACARS frequencies. The most common ones are 131.550 MHz, 131.725 MHz, 131.825 MHz, and 136.850 MHz. You can also use a frequency scanner or a web-based SDR to find other active frequencies in your area.
 
After tuning your dongle, you should start receiving and decoding ACARS messages on your screen. You can also save them to a file or send them to a server for further analysis or visualization. You can use tools like PlanePlotter[^3^] to plot the positions of aircraft based on their ACARS messages.
 
ACARS decoding is a fun and educational hobby that can give you insights into the operations of commercial aviation. With a simple RTL-SDR dongle and some software, you can access a wealth of information that is normally hidden from the public eye.

## Some Tips and Tricks for ACARS Decoding
 
If you want to get the most out of your ACARS decoding experience, here are some tips and tricks that might help you:

- Use a good antenna. A simple wire antenna or a telescopic whip antenna might work for some signals, but a dedicated VHF airband antenna will give you better results. You can also use a directional antenna, such as a yagi or a discone, to focus on specific directions or frequencies.
- Use a filter. ACARS signals are often weak and noisy, and they can be easily interfered by other signals in the same band. A bandpass filter can help you reduce the noise and improve the signal-to-noise ratio. You can also use a notch filter to eliminate specific interfering signals, such as FM radio stations.
- Use a preamplifier. A preamplifier can boost the signal level before it reaches your dongle, which can improve the decoding performance. However, be careful not to overload your dongle with too much gain, as this can cause distortion and clipping. You can also use an automatic gain control (AGC) to adjust the gain dynamically according to the signal strength.
- Use multiple dongles. If you want to decode more than one channel at a time, you can use multiple RTL-SDR dongles connected to your computer via a USB hub. You can then assign each dongle to a different frequency and run multiple instances of your ACARS decoding software. This way, you can monitor more traffic and increase your chances of catching interesting messages.
- Use online resources. There are many online resources that can help you with ACARS decoding, such as frequency lists, message formats, aircraft databases, flight trackers, and more. You can use these resources to identify the source and destination of the messages, decode the message content, correlate the messages with other data sources, and learn more about the aviation industry.

ACARS decoding is a rewarding hobby that can provide you with hours of fun and learning. With some basic equipment and software, you can explore a hidden world of digital communications that is constantly happening in the sky above you.
