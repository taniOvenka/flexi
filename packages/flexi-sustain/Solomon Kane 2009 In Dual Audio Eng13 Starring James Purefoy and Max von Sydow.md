# Solomon Kane 2009 In Dual Audio Eng13: A Review
 
Solomon Kane is a 2009 dark fantasy action-adventure film based on the character created by Robert E. Howard. The film stars James Purefoy as the titular hero, a 16th-century Puritan warrior who renounces his violent past and vows to live a peaceful life. However, when he learns that an evil sorcerer named Malachi (Jason Flemyng) is terrorizing England with his army of demonic creatures, he decides to take up arms again and stop him.
 
The film was directed by Michael J. Bassett and co-produced by Samuel Hadida and Paul Berrow. It was released in France on December 23, 2009 and in the United Kingdom on February 19, 2010. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the production values, the action scenes and Purefoy's performance, but criticized the script, the pacing and the lack of originality. It also performed poorly at the box office, grossing only $19.6 million worldwide against a budget of $40 million.

Solomon Kane 2009 In Dual Audio Eng13 is a good option for fans of dark fantasy and action films who want to enjoy the film in both languages. The Hindi dubbing is well-done and matches the tone and mood of the original film. The film itself is a decent adaptation of Howard's character, with some impressive visuals and thrilling fight sequences. However, it is not without its flaws, such as a weak plot, slow pacing and clichÃ©d characters. Therefore, it may not appeal to everyone.
  
The film is loosely based on the stories by Robert E. Howard, who created the character of Solomon Kane in 1928. Howard wrote several stories and poems featuring Kane, a 16th-century Puritan adventurer who travels the world fighting evil in various forms. The film incorporates elements from some of Howard's stories, such as "The Castle of the Devil", "The Right Hand of Doom" and "Blades of the Brotherhood", but also introduces new characters and plotlines.[^2^]
 
The film was originally conceived as a trilogy, with the first film focusing on Kane's origin story, the second film exploring his adventures in Africa and the third film depicting his final battle with the Devil. However, due to the film's poor performance at the box office and mixed reception from critics and fans, the sequels were never made. The film has since gained a cult following among some fans of Howard's works and dark fantasy genre.[^2^]
 
The film features a score composed by Klaus Badelt, who also worked on films such as Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, The Time Machine and Constantine. The score combines orchestral, choral and electronic elements to create a dark and epic atmosphere. The film also features a song by heavy metal band Soulfly, titled "Dark Ages", which plays during the end credits.[^1^]
