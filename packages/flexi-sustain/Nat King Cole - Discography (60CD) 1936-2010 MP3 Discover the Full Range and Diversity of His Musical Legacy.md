## The Early Years: The Nat King Cole Trio
 
Nat King Cole started his musical journey as a pianist, playing in various jazz bands in Chicago. He formed his own trio in 1937, with guitarist Oscar Moore and bassist Wesley Prince. The trio was one of the first to feature piano as the lead instrument, instead of guitar or saxophone. They also introduced vocal harmonies and occasional solo singing by Cole.
 
The trio recorded extensively for Decca and Capitol Records, producing hundreds of songs that showcased their innovative and swinging style. Some of their most famous recordings include "Straighten Up and Fly Right", "The Frim Fram Sauce", "Route 66", "Sweet Lorraine", and "Hit That Jive Jack". You can find many of these songs in the box set "The Complete Capitol Recordings of the Nat King Cole Trio" [^1^], which contains 18 CDs and over 300 tracks.
 
## The Solo Career: The King of Pop
 
In the late 1940s, Nat King Cole decided to focus more on his singing career, as he realized that his voice was more popular and profitable than his piano playing. He gradually shifted from jazz to pop, recording ballads, standards, novelty songs, and even country and Latin music. He also collaborated with some of the best arrangers and orchestras of the time, such as Nelson Riddle, Gordon Jenkins, Billy May, and Ralph Carmichael.
 
Some of his most successful albums from this period include "Unforgettable" [^2^], which features his signature song of the same name; "Love Is The Thing" [^3^], which contains his first number one hit "Stardust"; "The Very Thought Of You" , which showcases his romantic crooning; and "St. Louis Blues" , which is a tribute to his blues roots.
 
Nat King Cole also broke racial barriers as the first African American to host his own TV show, "The Nat King Cole Show", which aired from 1956 to 1957. He also appeared in several movies, such as "St. Louis Blues", "Cat Ballou", and "Night Of The Quarter Moon". He also toured extensively around the world, performing in Europe, Asia, Australia, and Latin America.
 
## The Final Years: The Legacy Continues
 
Nat King Cole's career was cut short by his untimely death from lung cancer in 1965, at the age of 45. However, his music continued to live on and influence generations of singers and musicians. His albums were reissued and remastered several times, and some of them were enhanced with new arrangements or duets with other artists.
