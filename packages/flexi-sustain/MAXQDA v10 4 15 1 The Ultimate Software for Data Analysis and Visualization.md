## Importing Data
 
The first step in using MAXQDA v10 4 15 1 is to import your data into the software. You can do this by clicking on the "Import" button in the toolbar and selecting the type of data you want to import. You can also drag and drop files from your computer into the "Document System" window on the left side of the screen. MAXQDA v10 4 15 1 supports various file formats, such as .docx, .txt, .pdf, .mp3, .mp4, .jpg, and .png.
 
Once you import your data, you will see them listed in the "Document System" window. You can rename, delete, move, or group your documents as you wish. You can also assign attributes to your documents, such as author, date, source, or any other relevant information. To do this, right-click on a document and select "Edit Document Variables". You can then enter the values for each attribute in the pop-up window.
  
## Creating Codes
 
The next step in using MAXQDA v10 4 15 1 is to create codes for your data. Codes are labels that you assign to segments of your data that represent themes, categories, concepts, or any other meaningful units of analysis. You can create codes in two ways: deductively or inductively. Deductively means that you have a predefined set of codes that you apply to your data based on a theoretical framework or a research question. Inductively means that you generate codes from your data as you read and interpret them.
 
To create codes deductively, you can use the "Code System" window on the right side of the screen. You can click on the "New Code" button in the toolbar and enter a name and a description for your code. You can also create subcodes by dragging and dropping codes onto each other. To create codes inductively, you can use the "In-Vivo Coding" function. This allows you to create codes from the exact words or phrases of your data. To do this, select a segment of your data in the "Document Browser" window in the center of the screen and right-click on it. Then select "In-Vivo Code" from the menu. A new code will be created with the same name as the selected segment.
